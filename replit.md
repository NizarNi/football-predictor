# Football Prediction - Safe Bet Analyzer

## Overview
A Flask-based web application providing football match predictions using real bookmaker odds. It fetches upcoming matches and live odds from over 30 bookmakers, converts odds to implied probabilities, detects arbitrage opportunities, and offers consensus predictions based on market data. The project aims to empower users with data-driven insights for sports betting.

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations. Ask before making major changes. I want iterative development. I prefer simple language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Responsive UI:** Utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive design.
- **Team Logos:** Displays team logos from a GitHub repository on match cards and prediction views.
- **Visual Cues:** Uses colored form indicators (ðŸŸ© Win, â¬œ Draw, ðŸŸ¥ Loss) and a visual ðŸ’° ARBITRAGE badge with a green gradient border for easy identification.
- **Autocomplete Search:** Features an autocomplete search bar with team nicknames, displaying team name, matched alias, and league with an 8-result limit.
- **Popular Match Highlighting:** Highlights Champions League and Europa League fixtures with a golden badge.

### Technical Implementations
- **Team Name Normalization:** Implements `fuzzyNormalizeTeamName()` and `normalizeTeamNameForLogo()` with extensive regex patterns and mappings to handle variations and generate correct logo URLs.
- **Odds Calculation:** Converts decimal/American odds to implied probabilities, averages probabilities for consensus, detects arbitrage opportunities, and calculates optimal stake distribution.
- **API Key Rotation:** Implements robust API key rotation for both The Odds API (3 keys) and football-data.org (3 keys) to manage rate limits and ensure high availability.
- **On-Demand Data Fetching:** Features "Show Over/Under Odds" and "Betting Analysis" buttons to load data only when clicked, optimizing API quota usage.
- **Enhanced Over/Under Calculation:** Averages data from 2.25, 2.5, and 2.75 goal lines for more robust Over/Under 2.5 predictions.
- **Intelligent Betting Tips:** Provides risk-based recommendations (Safest 60-80%, Balanced 30-50%, Value 15-30%).

### Feature Specifications
- **Odds-Based Predictions:** Predictions derived from real bookmaker consensus.
- **Arbitrage Detection:** Identifies arbitrage opportunities with profit margins and displays bookmaker names/odds for each stake.
- **Best Odds Display:** Shows the highest available odds for each outcome across all bookmakers.
- **Prediction Types:** Includes 1X2 (Home Win/Draw/Away Win) with implied probabilities, confidence scores, and bookmaker count.

- **Match Context:** Displays league standings, team positions, points, and form, and generates contextual match descriptions.

### System Design Choices
- **Flask Application:** Core web framework for the backend.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized into distinct files for API clients, odds calculation, and the main Flask application.
- **Gunicorn:** Used for production deployment with multiple worker processes for scalability.
- **Asynchronous Data Loading:** Deferring loading of "Over/Under" and "Betting Analysis" data to improve initial page load times and conserve API quota.
