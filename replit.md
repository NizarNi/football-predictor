# Football Prediction - Safe Bet Analyzer

## Overview
A Flask-based web application providing football match predictions using real bookmaker odds. It fetches upcoming matches and live odds from over 30 bookmakers, converts odds to implied probabilities, detects arbitrage opportunities, and offers consensus predictions based on market data. The project aims to empower users with data-driven insights for sports betting.

## Recent Changes

### Phase 5 - Chart Clarity & Premier League Fixes (2025-10-08) ‚úÖ
- **RENAMED**: "xG Diff" ‚Üí "Scoring Clinicality" with backward compatibility for cached data
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Flask route parameters changed from `<int:match_id>` to `<match_id>` to accept negative IDs from The Odds API
- **LOGO FIX**: Added Southampton FC, Leicester City, and Ipswich Town (2024-25 promoted teams) to logo mappings
- **CRYSTAL CLEAR CHARTS**: Prominent blue info box explains xG trend charts before display (green=xGF, red=xGA, interpretation guide)
- **ENHANCED TOOLTIPS**: Chart tooltips now show opponent, score, result (e.g., "vs Arsenal (2-1) - W"), rolling avg AND actual match xG
- **TOOLTIP FOOTER**: Automatic form interpretation on hover (‚úÖ Good form / ‚ùå Struggling / ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced)
- **Y-AXIS LABEL**: Charts now labeled "Expected Goals per Game" for clarity
- **VISIBLE ZERO-LINE**: Zero grid line thicker (2px) and darker (0.3 opacity) vs regular grid (1px, 0.05 opacity)
- **SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON**: Dedicated "xG Trend Comparison" section with charts displayed horizontally
- **VS SEPARATOR**: Home (blue badge) + "VS" divider + Away (red badge) layout for instant form comparison
- **TALLER CHARTS**: Comparison charts increased to 180px height for better visibility
- **GRACEFUL LAYOUT**: Single chart gets full width if only one team has data

### Phase 4 - xG Trend Visualizations & Transparency (2025-10-08) ‚úÖ
- **FIXED**: xG Diff calculation now shows per-game average instead of season total for accurate comparison
- **COMPREHENSIVE TOOLTIPS**: Info icons throughout app explain all calculations, factors, and data sources
- **MATCH-BY-MATCH DATA**: Backend fetches complete fixture logs from FBref with per-game xG, xGA, W/D/L results
- **ROLLING AVERAGES**: Calculates rolling 5-match xG/xGA averages to show recent form trends
- **FORM EXTRACTION**: Parses W/D/L results from match logs into visual form strings (e.g., "WWDLD")
- **ENHANCED API**: `/match/<event_id>/xg` now returns rolling_5, form, and recent_matches arrays
- **W/D/L INDICATORS**: Visual form display in Match Context with colored squares (üü© Win, ‚¨ú Draw, üü• Loss)
- **CHART.JS INTEGRATION**: Added Chart.js 4.4.0 CDN for interactive visualizations
- **XG TREND CHARTS**: Mini line charts showing rolling 5-match xG/xGA evolution with green/red filled areas
- **CHART INTEGRATION**: xG trend visualizations embedded in Match Context below team stats
- **MEMORY MANAGEMENT**: Proper chart lifecycle (destroy old, create new) prevents memory leaks
- **EN-DASH FIX**: Score parsing handles both hyphen (-) and en-dash (‚Äì) from FBref data
- **GRACEFUL HANDLING**: All new features degrade gracefully when data unavailable (early season, unsupported leagues)

### Phase 3 - xG Analytics Integration (2025-10-08) ‚úÖ
- **NEW BACKEND MODULE**: `xg_data_fetcher.py` fetches real Expected Goals data from FBref via soccerdata library
- **REAL DATA**: Uses shooting stats (xGF), keeper_adv stats (PSxG for xGA), and standard stats (matches played)
- **DEPENDENCY FIX**: Downgraded lxml to 5.3.0 to resolve MultiIndex DataFrame parsing issues with soccerdata 1.8.2
- **API ENDPOINT**: `/match/<event_id>/xg` returns comprehensive xG predictions with 24-hour caching
- **MATCH CONTEXT**: Displays xGF/xGA per game and xG overperformance (goals vs expected) for both teams
- **BETTING TIPS**: New "xG Analysis" section shows expected goals prediction, result probability, and Over/Under 2.5 recommendation
- **INTELLIGENT CACHING**: 24-hour JSON cache per league significantly reduces FBref API calls
- **SEASON LOGIC**: Uses previous complete season (2024) when current season is early (August-November) for more reliable data
- **LEAGUE SUPPORT**: xG available for top 5 domestic leagues only (PL, PD, BL1, SA, FL1) - not Champions/Europa League
- **GRACEFUL DEGRADATION**: System handles unsupported leagues elegantly; xG sections simply don't appear
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Clear `currentXgData` on match selection to prevent stale xG data from appearing in betting tips
- **DATA FRESHNESS**: xG data shared between Match Context and Betting Analysis with proper state management

### Phase 2 - UI/Filter Improvements (2025-10-08) ‚úÖ
- **REDESIGNED**: Top section with centered, larger search bar (80% width, prominent position)
- **NEW FEATURE**: Unified filter bar with clean horizontal layout and centered alignment
- **NEW FEATURE**: "Bet Opportunities" dropdown filter - Very Safe (‚â•88%), Safe (‚â•75%), Moderate (‚â•60%), All Matches
- **INTELLIGENT**: Filter analyzes 1X2 predictions (HOME_WIN, DRAW, AWAY_WIN) to find high-confidence bets
- **MOVED**: Arbitrage checkbox integrated into unified filter bar (removed from matches section)
- **NEW FEATURE**: Dynamic filter badge showing count (e.g., "5 Very Safe Bets Found", "10 Arbitrage Opportunities")
- **ENHANCED**: Filters work cumulatively (arbitrage + confidence threshold both apply)
- **IMPROVED**: League buttons reorganized with "Browse by League:" label for better UX
- **CODE CLEANUP**: Removed old filterHtml generation, toggleArbitrageFilter function, inline filter UI
- **ARCHITECTURE**: New applyFilters() function reads current filter state from DOM and re-renders
- **HELPER FUNCTIONS**: getMaxBettingConfidence() evaluates match confidence, updateFilterBadge() manages counter display
- **FUTURE-READY**: Filter logic will automatically include Over/Under when backend pre-loads totals data

### Phase 1 - Logo System Improvements (2025-10-08) ‚úÖ
- **ENHANCED**: League-gated fuzzy team name normalization prevents cross-league collisions (Inter Miami ‚â† Inter Milan, Paris FC ‚â† PSG)
- **ADDED**: `fuzzyNormalizeTeamName()` function with 25+ regex patterns for common team name variations
- **IMPROVED**: League detection handles variations (Premier League/EPL/epl, La Liga/Spain/PD, etc.)
- **FIXED**: Autocomplete dropdown z-index significantly increased (parent: 10000, dropdown: 99999) for proper stacking above matches section
- **ARCHITECTURE**: Logo URL generation flow: fuzzyNormalizeTeamName ‚Üí normalizeTeamNameForLogo ‚Üí fallback to original name
- **SAFE**: Returns original team name if no pattern matches (graceful degradation for unknown teams/leagues)

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations. Ask before making major changes. I want iterative development. I prefer simple language.
