The FPL-Elo-Insights repository makes predictions by combining real-world data, a classic rating system for team strength, and machine learning. Its approach differs significantly from bookmakers' odds, focusing on historical performance data rather than market sentiment.

Here is a comparison of these different forecasting methods:

Feature	FPL-Elo-Insights & Data-Driven Models	Bookmakers' Odds
Primary Input	Historical performance data (goals, xG, passes, etc.) and Elo ratings	Market-driven probabilities, adjusted for public betting and bookmaker margin
Core Method	Statistical and Machine Learning models trained on past data	Implied probability derived from betting odds
Key Output	Expected points, goals, assists for FPL	Anytime scorer probability, clean sheet odds, match winner
Best For	Long-term FPL planning, identifying underlying player performance	Short-term (next match) decisions, captaincy picks, bench order
ðŸ§  How FPL-Elo-Insights Makes Predictions
The project builds its forecasts on a foundation of diverse data and modeling techniques.

Data Sources: The model fuses three powerful streams of information: the official FPL API (for points, cost, form), manually curated match stats (for detailed, Opta-like metrics), and dynamic team Elo ratings from ClubElo.com. This provides a rich dataset for analysis.

Team Strength with Elo: The system uses the Elo rating system to dynamically quantify team strength. A team's rating increases with a win and decreases with a loss, with the amount of change depending on the match result and the opponent's strength. This provides a powerful, context-aware metric for fixture difficulty analysis.

Machine Learning Models: Advanced models, like the "Massive Data Model" mentioned in search results, are machine learning algorithms fed with performance data over various timeframes. They are context-aware, factoring in a player's role, set-piece duties, and finishing history to make predictions that are more descriptive of a player's true underlying performance level.
